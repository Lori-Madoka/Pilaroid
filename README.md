# Pilaroid
A raspberry pi in a Polaroid - the Pilaroid

## Dependencies
requires Luma (pip3 install luma)
requires PIL (pip3 install Pillow)
requires RPi.GPIO (pip3 install RPi.GPIO)

## Functionality
I aim to be able to have printing functionality working soon when printer arrives.
Setup your pi to boot and auto log in and then set a script to autorun and start a virtual environment as well as run the python script.
Single press of shutter button to take a photo, hold shutter button for 10 seconds to power off.
I am yet to find a reliable way of powering on the Pi from an off state without cycling the power supply.
